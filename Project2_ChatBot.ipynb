    "TODO: I selected the `character_descriptions.csv` dataset to build a custom chatbot that can help users explore fictional characters from movies, theatre, and TV. This chatbot would be useful for writers, actors, or fans who want to learn about character backgrounds, traits, or the settings they come from. By integrating character-specific data into the modelâ€™s context, we ensure that the chatbot responds accurately using this fictional universe, rather than generating vague or hallucinated information."
